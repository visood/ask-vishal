--- Professional Interests ---

Olena's path forward has two tracks:

Track 1 (preferred): Complete Swiss medical equivalence and return to clinical cardiology
- Pass the FMH examination
- Obtain a position as a medecin assistant in cardiology at a Swiss hospital
- Long-term goal: establish herself as a cardiologist in the Swiss healthcare system

Track 2 (parallel): Leverage clinical expertise in medtech/clinical research
- Clinical research management roles at Swiss pharmaceutical or medtech companies
- Medical Science Liaison (MSL) positions in cardiology
- Clinical affairs roles at medical device companies (leveraging echocardiography expertise)
- Medical writing and regulatory affairs for clinical documentation

Olena brings something rare to the Swiss job market: deep clinical experience from a high-volume, resource-constrained environment, combined with research credentials, teaching ability, and the resilience of someone who rebuilt her career from scratch in a new country. She is not starting over --- she is translating 12 years of expertise into a new context.
